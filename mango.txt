To embed or not to embed:
1. Is the embedded data wanted 80% of the time?
2. How often do you want the embedded data without
the containing document?(embedded comes with all)
3. Is the embedded data a bounded set?(needs to be small, not scaleable)
4. Is that bound small? (documents limited to 16mb)
5. How varied are your queries? (don't want varied data)
6. Is this an intergration database or application database?
